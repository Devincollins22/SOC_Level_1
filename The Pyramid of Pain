# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Notes – Beginner Level

These are my study notes while learning the basics of **threat detection** and the **Pyramid of Pain**.

## 🔺 The Pyramid of Pain
Created by **David Bianco**, the Pyramid of Pain shows how hard it is for an attacker (adversary) to change certain indicators of compromise (IoCs).  
The higher you go, the more **pain** for the attacker.  

### Layers (Bottom → Top)
1. **Hash Values**  
   - Unique fingerprints of files.  
   - Easy for attackers to change by re-compiling malware.  

2. **IP Addresses**  
   - Numerical addresses for servers.  
   - Attackers can switch IPs easily.  

3. **Domain Names**  
   - Human-readable names (e.g., `evilcorp.com`).  
   - Harder to change (must buy/register domains).  

4. **Network Artifacts**  
   - Patterns of traffic, headers, protocol quirks.  
   - Harder for attackers to modify without re-coding tools.  

5. **Tools**  
   - Malware, Remote Access Tools (RATs) like **Cobalt Strike**.  
   - If defenders block these, attackers must buy/build new ones.  

6. **TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures)**  
   - **Tactics** = attacker goals (e.g., initial access).  
   - **Techniques** = how they try (e.g., phishing).  
   - **Procedures** = exact implementation (e.g., malicious Excel macro).  
   - Most painful for attackers to change.

## 🔑 Key Terms
- **Adversary**: The attacker, threat actor, or hacking group.  
- **Domain Name**: An address to access websites (`tryhackme.com`).  
- **Punycode Attack**: Using Unicode characters to mimic legit domains (e.g., `adıdas.de`).  
- **Fuzzy Hashes**: Also called *context-triggered piecewise hashes*; used to detect similar files.  
- **Cobalt Strike**: A commercial Remote Access Tool often abused for C2 and data theft.  
- **User-Agent String**: Identifies the browser/OS in HTTP requests.  
- **POST Request**: HTTP method used to send data to a server (e.g., login forms).  
- **CN (Common Name)**: Field in digital certificates, usually the domain the cert is issued for.

## 🌍 URL Shorteners
Attackers often hide malicious domains with shorteners (e.g., bit.ly, tinyurl).  
- To **preview** where a TinyURL goes: add `preview.` before `tinyurl.com`.  
  - Example:  
    - `https://tinyurl.com/abcd1234`  
    - `https://preview.tinyurl.com/abcd1234`

## 🕵️ Example: Chimera Group
- China-based hacking group active since 2018.  
- Uses **Cobalt Strike** as their RAT for C2 and data exfiltration.

## 📌 Summary
- Low-level indicators (hashes, IPs) are easy for attackers to change.  
- High-level indicators (TTPs) cause attackers real pain when defenders detect them.  
- Focus defense on **behavior (TTPs)**, not just simple signatures.
